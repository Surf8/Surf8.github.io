          <h2>Glen Etive</h2>
          <p>
            <br />
            Picture this: a magical place called Glen Etive (Scottish Gaelic:
            Gleann Èite), nestled in the stunning Highlands of Scotland. It's
            home to the mighty River Etive (Scottish Gaelic: Abhainn Èite),
            which begins its journey on the peaks surrounding Rannoch Moor.Along
            the way, it's joined by a wild bunch of tributary streams, like a
            group of rowdy friends crashing a party at the Kings House Hotel.

            <br />
            Listen up, folks! Get ready to explore the wondrous Mugdock Country
            Park - a park so cool, it's partly in East Dunbartonshire and partly
            in Stirling, in the former county of Stirlingshire, Scotland. You'll
            find it just a hop, skip, and a jump away from Glasgow - only 10
            miles (16 kilometres) north to be exact! And if you're wondering how
            to get there, fear not! It's as easy as pie, located right next to
            Milngavie, which is like the VIP entrance to this awesome park.

          <p>
            <br />
            Hear ye, hear ye! Gather 'round, folks - I've got some Scottish
            scoop for ya. You know what they say: good things come in small
            packages. Well, that couldn't be truer when it comes to Loch Drunkie
            (Scottish Gaelic: Loch Drongaidh). This wee freshwater loch is
            tucked away in the picturesque Trossachs, near the charming town of
            Aberfoyle in the Stirling council area of bonnie Scotland. Don't let
            its small size fool you - it's a hidden gem that's waiting to be
            discovered.
