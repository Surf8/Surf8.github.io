        <h2>Glen Etive</h2>

        <p>
          Picture this: a magical place called Glen Etive (Scottish Gaelic:
          Gleann Èite), nestled in the stunning Highlands of Scotland. It's home
          to the mighty River Etive (Scottish Gaelic: Abhainn Èite), which
          begins its journey on the peaks surrounding Rannoch Moor. Along the
          way, it's joined by a wild bunch of tributary streams, like a group of
          rowdy friends crashing a party at the Kings House Hotel. From there,
          the Etive embarks on an epic 18 km journey, braving rapids and
          obstacles like a boss, until it finally reaches its ultimate goal: the
          sea loch, Loch Etive. It's no wonder that this river and its
          tributaries are a hit with whitewater kayakers. In fact, at high water
          levels, it's like an extreme sports playground, a true test of one's
          skills and a classic run. So, if you're up for an adventure, grab your
          paddle and join the party!

        <h2>Inverness</h2>
        <div><img src="images/viewpic6.png" alt="Inverness City" /></div>
        <p>
          Ah, Inverness - the city with a name that's hard to say but easy to
          love!, for those of you who were wondering.) This wee city in the
          Scottish Highlands is more than just a pretty face, though. It's the
          administrative centre for The Highland Council and is known as the
          capital of the Highlands. And let me tell ya, this place has seen its
          fair share of battles. From the 11th-century battle of Blàr nam Fèinne
          against Norway to the infamous Battle of Culloden, which took place on
          Culloden Moor in the 18th century - Inverness has got some serious
          fight in it! But don't worry, laddies and lassies, the only battle
          you'll be facing in Inverness is trying to decide which whisky to
          order at the local pub. (And if you can't decide, just order them all
          and call it a "whisky tasting.") So, next time you're in the Scottish
          Highlands, swing by Inverness and raise a glass to the city that's as
          tough as it is charming. Slàinte mhath! (That's Scottish for
          "Cheers!")

        <h2>Ben Vorlich</h2>
        <div><img src="images/viewpic7.png" alt="Ben Vorlich" /></div>
        <p>
          Ye ken, Ben Vorlich is like a bonnie giant keepin' watch over the
          Arrochar Alps of Argyll in the Southern Highlands of Scotland. This
          big lad stands tall at 943 metres (that's 3,094 feet for ye
          non-Scots), makin' it a Munro - and a bonnie one at that! It sits
          right between the breathtaking Loch Lomond and Loch Sloy. And let me
          tell ye, the views from the top are as grand as a ceilidh on Hogmanay!
          But don't let Ben Vorlich's impressive height fool ye - the A82 road
          and the West Highland railway line run right along its eastern side,
          keepin' the mountain company as it overlooks the beautiful Loch
          Lomond. It's like a wee parade for the mountain, with cars and trains
          goin' by, sayin' "Hello, Ben Vorlich! You're lookin' bonnie today!" So
          if ye want to experience the beauty and majesty of the Scottish
          Highlands, take a hike up Ben Vorlich and give a wee wave to the
          passing cars and trains. And who knows, maybe ye'll even see a kilted
          hiker or two!

        <p>
          Ah, Whaligoe, a wee port with a big history! Thomas Telford himself
          thought it was a "terrible spot", but Captain David Brodie had other
          ideas. He said "I'll take it from here, lads!" and spent a mere £8 to
          cut the now famous 330 steps. And what do you know, the harbour ended
          up supporting 14 herring boats! That just goes to show, never judge a
          port by its cover.

        <h2>Another Glen Etive</h2>
        <div><img src="images/viewpic9.png" alt="Ben Vorlich" /></div>
        <p>
          Ah, have ye heard of Glen Etive? Aye, it's a bonnie glen nestled in
          the heart o' the Scottish Highlands. The River Etive, or Abhainn Èite
          as we say in Gaelic, runs through it, and it's a popular spot for
          whitewater kayaking. But that's not all, there's much to explore here!
          Take a wee drive down the narrow road from Kings House Hotel and
          you'll find yourself surrounded by stunning scenery, with houses and
          farms dotting the landscape. And if you're feeling adventurous, you
          can continue along the rough tracks that hug the shores of the loch.
          Trust me, you won't be disappointed!

        <p>
          Ahoy there! The Kilpatrick Hills, aye they're a bonnie wee range o'
          hills in central Scotland, stretching frae Dumbarton tae Strathblane.
          Ye can find them just north o' the bonnie Loch Lomond an' the
          Trossachs National Park. Tae the east, they're divided by Strathblane
          frae the Campsie Fells. And let's nae forget, they're surrounded by
          some bonnie wee settlements like Balloch, Clydebank, and Milngavie.
          But dinnae worry, ye dinnae need tae be a hiker tae enjoy the views,
          ye can just sit back and enjoy the stunning vistas o'er a wee dram.
